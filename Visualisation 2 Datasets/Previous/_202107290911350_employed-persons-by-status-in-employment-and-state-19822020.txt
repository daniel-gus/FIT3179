This data set shows the number of employed persons by status in employment for all states in Malaysia for year 1982 until 2020. The statistics is derived from Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is conducted every month using household approach.

Employed persons are those between the working age of 15-64 years old who at any time during the reference week of LFS had worked at least one hour for pay, profit or family gain (as an employer, employee, own-account worker or unpaid family worker).
